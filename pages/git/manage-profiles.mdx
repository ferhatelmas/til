## How to manage different git profiles?

Use git config includes.

Let's say we have a generic profile that stays in `~/.gitconfig`.
We also have a work profile that we need to use for work related commits (i.e. different email, signing, etc.).

If our general development happens in `~/dev` and we put work related repos under `~/dev/work`,
then we can add overrides into a file `~/.gitconfig-work`, for example.

#### .gitconfig

```
[user]
    name = Hero
    email = dev@abc.com
[includeIf "gitdir:~/dev/work"]
    path = ~/.gitconfig-work
```

#### .gitconfig-work

```
[user]
    name = Hero
    email = dev@work.com
    signingkey = 123467
[commit]
    gpgsign = true
```
